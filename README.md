# üåê A time zone helper

tz helps you schedule things across time zones. It is an interactive TUI
program that displays time across a few time zones of your choosing.


# Usage

Simply run `tz` with no arguments to show the local time, as well as the
UTC time zone. It gets more interesting once you set the `TZ_LIST`
environment variable with a comma-separated list of [tz data][tzdata]
zone names (see Configuration below).

Run it with the `-q` argument if you want it to exit
immediatiely. When run without `-q` you can toggle the date indicator.

The program will adjust to light and dark terminals themes.

### Override local display name
tz, by default, displays your local timezone as "Local". If you rather like
to display a different name there instead, you can use the `-l` flag to 
to override it.

`$ tz -l <local name>`

### Time display format
In the header line, tz will display the current time. By default the time format
for the time is in 12H format. If you prefer to display the time in 24H format,
you can do so by setting the `-24` flag

`$ tz -24`

# Installing

The simplest thing is probably to grab a release, but no one will be
harmed if you build from source, as only linux/amd64 builds are provided
for now.

## Packages

If you're an Archlinux user, packages are also available:

  - [tz][tz-arch] follows releases and,
  - [tz-git][tz-arch-git] builds the `main` git branch.

[tz-arch]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tz
[tz-arch-git]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tz-git


# Configuration

TZ uses standard time zones as described
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
You can specify what time zones you want displayed by setting the
`TZ_LIST` environment variable. Your local time will always be
displayed. So, if you wanted to display local time + time in
California, and Paris you would set your `TZ_LIST` to
`US/Pacific,Europe/Paris`

## Zone Alias

tz is configured only through `TZ_LIST`, and that limits us to the tz
database names, but you can alias these names using a special value: the
tz name followed by `;` and your alias:

`TZ_LIST="Europe/Paris;EMEA office,US/Central;US office"`

# Building

You need a recent-ish release of go with modules support:

```
git clone https://github.com/oz/tz
cd tz
go build
```


# Testing

```
go test -cover
```
